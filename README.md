Offering cancelled = BULLISH & form RW = offering cancelled

When was the last time you made 50-70% intraday / overnight?


This is not financial advice.
This is simply a way to track potential overnight baggers.
This program is mainly for day traders and not for the faint of heart.
Make sure to do your DD before you buy or sell any stocks.
I personally don't need much DD for this one.

There are many ways to track RW forms and this is just 1 of them.
If you don't know what an RW form is pleace go ahead and Google it.

This program will get you RW forms through the handle @FintelAlerts on Twitter.
You could also retrieve the same forms at https://sec.report/Form/RW

My most recent form RW alert on Twitter was PETZ on July 12. **It did over 70% overnight.**
It was rejected at VWAP and then found support at 200ema (10m chart) for anyone who wanted a piece of the cake (easy 30-50% intraday)

Check out your chart if you're not familiar with this bullish pattern.

Feel free to use this Python program whaterver way you want. Maybe you could built something robust with it for other traders.

More people = more volume = more demand = more profits for all (hopefully).

PS: There is almost always 1 offering that get cancelled every other week.
