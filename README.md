Offering cancelled = BULLISH & form RW = offering cancelled

When was the last time you made 50-70% intraday or overnight?


This is not financial advice.
This is simply a way to track potential multi-baggers.
This program is mainly for day traders, and not for the faint of heart.
I personally don't need much DD for this setup.

There are many ways to track RW forms and this is just 1 of them.
This program basically gets you RW forms through the handle @FintelAlerts on Twitter.
You could also retrieve the same forms at https://sec.report/Form/RW

This way is better to me as you get the **ticker symbol** along with the link to the form.
You could then use the ticker symbol for various programming purposes right off the bat.
imo, saving time is everything for day traders (bots/humans).

If you don't know what an RW form is, pleace Google it.

My most recent form RW alert on Twitter was PETZ on July 12. ***"It did over 70% overnight."***
It was rejected at VWAP before end of AH trading session, and then found support at 200ema PM (10m chart).
For anyone who wanted a piece of the pie, this was an easy 30-50% intraday play.

Bring up the chart for PETZ on July 12 - July 13, 2022 to study - if you're not familiar with this bullish pattern.

Feel free to use this Python program whaterver way you want. Maybe you could built something robust around it to help other traders.

More people = more volume = more demand = more profits for all (hopefully).

There is almost always 1 offering that get cancelled every other week.

***PS: 30% - 50% weekly = you could turn $100 into $1M in 1 year with that.***
